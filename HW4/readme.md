## Homework 4

### Inferring from Weather Data

In this homework, you are required to go through the notebooks in [Section2-Weather-PCA](https://github.com/ucsd-edx/CSE255-DSE230-2018/tree/master/Sections/Section2-Weather-PCA) (please 'git pull' the latest changes) and make modifications to it in order to answer the questions below. Note that you will have to change variables such as state names, measurement type, etc. Specifically in this homework, you will be working on weather data for the state of Washington. The measurements that you will be working with are PRCP_s20 and TOBS_s20. It is recommended that you watch and understand week 3 & 4 videos before attempting this homework.

All the details needed to solve this homework can be found in [Section2-Weather-PCA](https://github.com/ucsd-edx/CSE255-DSE230-2018/tree/master/Sections/Section2-Weather-PCA). Look into [Readme](https://github.com/ucsd-edx/CSE255-DSE230-2018/blob/master/Sections/Section2-Weather-PCA/0.%20README.ipynb) for details on how to download datasets for the state of Washington. Notebooks [3](https://github.com/ucsd-edx/CSE255-DSE230-2018/blob/master/Sections/Section2-Weather-PCA/3.%20Weather%20Analysis%20-%20Initial%20Visualisation.ipynb), [4](https://github.com/ucsd-edx/CSE255-DSE230-2018/blob/master/Sections/Section2-Weather-PCA/4.%20Weather%20Analysis%20-%20reconstruction%20SNWD.ipynb), [5](https://github.com/ucsd-edx/CSE255-DSE230-2018/blob/master/Sections/Section2-Weather-PCA/5.%20maps%20using%20iPyLeaflet.ipynb), [6](https://github.com/ucsd-edx/CSE255-DSE230-2018/blob/master/Sections/Section2-Weather-PCA/6.%20Is%20SNWD%20variation%20spatial%20or%20temporal.ipynb) can then be used to interpret results with respect to the precipitation and temperature measurements. You will need to modify these notebooks to gather statistics on the PRCP_s20 and TOBS_s20
